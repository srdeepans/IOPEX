Description : **Developed a responsive landing page for the fictional restaurant Taste Buds using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The page includes a header with a logo, a section highlighting three featured dishes with images and descriptions and some more dishes, and a footer with social media links. I sourced royalty-free images from Freepik, optimized them with TinyPNG for faster load times, and designed the logo in Adobe Photoshop. Media queries ensure smooth layout adjustments on mobile devices, and performance optimization techniques enhance the user experience on both desktop and mobile views.**
